# eNESimo

The name eNESimo comes from Spanish "en√©simo", meaning simply "nth".

So yes, this is yet another unneeded NES emulator in the NES emulation scene. For now, my main goal in developing this emulator is to understand the fascinating architecture of the NES.

Without a shred of a doubt, one of the main difficulties of putting together a NES emulator from scratch is finding one's way through the abundant and, at times, unclear documentation. Sometimes the best way to understand a given specification is to see it implemented in a working emulator. If eNESimo can be useful for this, then I will be very happy. ;)
